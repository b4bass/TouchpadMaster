# TouchpadMaster

TouchpadMaster is a World of Warcraft Classic addon designed for players who use trackpads or touchpads. It enables left-click-only mouselook and unit targeting, allowing you to move and interact in-game without needing multitouch gestures. This makes movement and targeting much easier for laptop users or anyone playing without a traditional mouse.

- Toggle the addon with a keybind (default: CTRL-SHIFT-M, configurable in the WoW Key Bindings interface under AddOns > TouchpadMaster).
- Simple slash commands for configuration: `/touchpad help` for options.

Perfect for MacBook, laptop, and trackpad users who want a smoother WoW experience!
